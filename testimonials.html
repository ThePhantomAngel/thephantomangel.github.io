Sorry I haven’t replied earlier. But rest assured, it isn’t because I’ve been disappointed with my Inspire Angel. I LOVE it! It solves the ongoing problem I’ve had of charging more batteries than needed to do a job and then having to discharge the batteries to a storage charge until needed next. I find I’m using the Angel pretty much after every time I go flying...

As far as my Phantom Angel is concerned, I love it !  Unfortunately due to life and weather I have not been flying much at all.  The flip side to that is I end up using the Angel more than not due to having to maintain my batteries as they have been sitting most of the time.  As I posted on your comment section, just yesterday I spent the day cycling all my batteries.  As we had discussed prior to my purchase, I wanted to be able to use this on my Autel batteries.  It has worked like a charm !  The Autel battery smart head must be very similar to the DJI batteries.  This has reset the capacity counter on those problematic Autel batteries and made them perform like they should  Thanks for all the help and for your great product !

			<i>"Hi Alex,

We have been on an extended vacation so I missed your email without wifi.  

The Angel has been in frequent use since I received it several months ago and is especially useful when I am not able to fly because of long periods of high winds along the coast of Oregon.  I often charge up all my batteries for the P4P and Mavic to take advantage of a weather window only to see the conditions collapse.  The ability to take all the batteries back to storage condition is very useful and will most likely extend their service life.

A few of my older P4P batteries have entered the reset time and the Angel has done everything necessary to accomplish that.

The device is working just fine and I have no suggestions for improvement.  If I can think of anything in the future, I will most certainly let you know.

I have told friends about the Angel and at least one will place an order soon.

Keep up the good work Alex!!

All the best,

The Phantom Angel is appealing to me as I have 12 batteries for the Inspire as we can do 20 missions a day from a small boat with limited charging, so we need a pile of batteries and doing the right thing for them will be a whole lot easier with your unit. I looked at the four bank charger that has the store function on it, but portability is really important for me given the various boat platforms we work off.

			<i>"Hi Alex

The product arrived as expected. I've already tested it and it’s working a lot better than I imagined. It’s nice to have the option for storage or calibration. I’ve used the calibration mode yesterday and it took about 44 minutes do completely discharge an Inspire 1 TB47 battery. It’s outstanding because, to make the same calibration with the inspire, the battery as to be in the device, turned on, for more than 2 hours, even after a flight with 20% of remaining charge. This is a painful procedure and it always has it’s costs in the Inspire materials. Being connected and with all sensors active for so long it’s not a good idea for material preservation for sure. 
Thank you!

Love the Phantom Angel. I've recommended to a few people on Inspire Pilots. My only comment for improvement would be to have some sort of detachable cover to protect the bulb when it's installed. Since you can't touch it with bare hands, I prefer to leave it installed when I'm not using it. It would be nice to have some extra layer of protection so I don't damage it.

			<i>"I have used both Angels, P4 and Inspire) once since I received them.  Both worked flawlessly, as expected.  You do fine work Alex and I can't see how they could be improved.  Wonderful job.

I spread the word all the time about the Angels and hope that some of the people I talk to buy an Angel.  I definately highly recommend the Angel.

Thanx.....

			<i>"Just got back from vacation and decided to run my batteries through my new Angel. Currently # 2 of 4 going through the process. This thing is AWESOME!!! So glad I found out about you on the Inspire website, I will be spreading the word about the Angel. Makes the discharge/storage cycles so much better than trying to guess where the battery was in a cycle. Thanks so much for making the Perfect Tool !!!"</i><br><br>
