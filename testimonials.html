			<i>"Purchased the Inspire Angel January 2016 & received it March. Well worth the wait, Alex provides the GREATEST customer service, personally emailing me regarding the delay of shipping out my Angel, it was because he wanted me to have version 2.0. And now I'm FINALLY able to put the Angel to work for the first time 7 months later. Using 10 batts between two i1's the Angel is so convenient when calibrating the batts as well as getting them set for storage. Quality build that feels "solid" no complaints here!! Looking to buy a second one in the future, thanks Alex for a practical product as well as top notch service"</i><br><br>

			<i>"Yup - they're a good piece of kit and work well......just mind your eyes (the bulb is VERY bright)
Storage charge mode is brilliant as well. It means you can go out with all your batteries fully charged and if you don't use them all just pop them on the Angel when you get home and bring them down to storage charge.
That was a nightmare previously!"</i><br><br>

So glad I found out about you on the Inspire website, I will be spreading the word about the Angel. Makes the discharge/storage cycles so much better than trying to guess where the battery was in a cycle. Thanks so much for making the Perfect Tool !!!"</i><br><br>
