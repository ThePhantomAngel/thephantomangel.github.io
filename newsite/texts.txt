Hi guys,

A couple of months ago I made a little gadget called the Phantom Angel (http://phantomangel.rocks) to help Phantom owners discharge their LiPos to a good storage level. I spread the word around the forums and facebook and so on and was very surprised with the reaction I got.
The majority of new pilots (Phantom pilots to be precise) were not aware of standard LiPo practices and were surprised and grateful when I shared some of what I've learnt over the years.

So, with that in mind, I've created a concise, newbie-friendly guide to all things LiPo.

Hope you find it useful and please do send over any and all thoughts and comments.

Hi guys,

Since launching the Phantom Angel  (a dedicated P2/P3 battery storage discharger) a couple of months ago I've had loads of discussions with Phantom pilots about their batteries.
What I saw was that the majority of new pilots were not aware of standard LiPo practices and were surprised and grateful when I shared some of what I've learnt over the years.

So, with that in mind, I've created a concise, newbie-friendly guide to all things LiPo. If you don't know how to store your battiers, how to keep them from exploding or how to tell your watts from your amps, this guide's for you :)
